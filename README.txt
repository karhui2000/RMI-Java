In this folder consists of 4 java files.There will be castVote.java ,castVoteImp.java, client.java and server.java.

How to run: start 3 terminal.first terminal will be used for registry of RMI according your devices(window/OS/linux).Then compile both javac client.java and server.java .Lastly, use java client and server for each terminal.

Note: The result will be displayed after you cast the vote on client.For multiple voting, you need to run the client multiple times(to see all results).Also, please wait 5 seconds to cast your vote. Because ,if your ticket is invalid, it takes couple of seconds to pop invalid prompt out from the screen. In my program, i have generated some invalid tickets(11-20) and valid tickets(1-10).
